You've learned a lot about web development so far. 

I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 

Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
 
	
	I haven't really learned anything new yet, but I would say that it has been nice to re-learn and re-see some of the 	building blocks that I may have forgotten or not used in a while.
 
* What has been easy?

	
	It has all been pretty easy, the direction is good and I have used Udacity before so that helps.
  
* What has been difficult?
 

	I honestly don't feel like anything has been difficult.
 
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


		
	The first project guided me very well and set me up for success on this project.
	I used google and mdn.

Thanks
